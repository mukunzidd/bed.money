				<h5>Did COVID19 Pandemic affect the way your clients pay you?</h5>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Before COVID people use to pay me cash. But now because of government encourage cashless,
						people, like 99% of my clients nowadays are using mobile money. Few people can pay me cash.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like you can even find me cashless.
						For example, you can surprise me and ask me one Rwf 1000, and I won't have it because people pay
						using
						mobile money.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h5>
					What if a client has money at the bank can they pay with a card?
				</h5>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						What htey do is that they'll withdraw their money using mobile banking. Because it's linked with
						their mobile money, then can just transfer it to their mobile money and then they can pay me
						with it.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<h5>
					Why do you choose to use an expensive Telecom network for your mobile money transcations whne
					there's a cheaper alternative, in this case MTN versus Airtel?
				</h5>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Airtel is the best network compared to MTN. The problem is that we're already used to using MTN
						services. Our firends, our families, our bosses, our clients all use MTN on the daily. It's hard
						to call someone who won't call you back because they are using another network. So, if you look
						at the cost-effectiveness, Airtel is the best. Even the internet is very fast.
					</p>
					<p>On the other hand, Airtel has a lot of work to do even if they are doing some advertisement. I
						think that the reason why we're sticking to MTN is that our people, our friends are on MTN. So,
						it's hard to tell someone: "Do you have Airtel? I want to send you some money." But as people
						buy Airtel for internet, they'll end up using it for other services too, like SMS and calling
						even mobile money. </p>

					Are you comfortable giving your phone number to an app that you just downloaded?
