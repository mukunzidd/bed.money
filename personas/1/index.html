					<em>Time is money, but stay frugal.</em> Works full-time but also has

					as safer but not necessarily quicker. Would prefer to create a new
					Gmail account to get an additional 15GB of space, instead of getting a

					<h5>In your side business, how do your customers pay you?</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							What I do is translation services for different clients in Rwanda,
							and elsewhere in the world. So there are different ways they pay
							me. Rwandan people, pay me through mobile money and bank accounts.
							Abroad, they sometimes use Western union and some others wire
							directly to my local bank account.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h5>
						Why do you think that using mobile money is the easiest way to pay?
					</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							With mobile money you only send what you need to send. You
							don&#39;t have to be stuck [waiting for change] with a motor
							driver or someone whom you&#39;re buying vegetables from.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let&#39;s say he only wants 200, you have 5K in your pocket, you
							don&#39;t have the change and you can&#39;t trust the person to
							give him all your money. With mobile money if he wants 200, send
							him 200, then walk away. So it&#39;s quick, you don&#39;t have to
							negotiate.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote style="display: none;">
						<p>
							Say you are on a bike, you ask the motor driver the number of his
							mobile money and finish the transaction. By the minute you reach
							to where you&#39;re going you&#39;re done then you walk away.
						</p>
						<p>
							(I like mobile money, because I can avoid problems when its late
							at night and the driver doesn&#39;t have change. People are
							reluctant to help you get change when its late at night)

						What do you do when an application you have just downloaded asks you

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							There are these apps that you know, for sure that they need it,

							Instagram, I know for a fact they will need it to generate my
							contacts and make me communicate with people.
						</p>
